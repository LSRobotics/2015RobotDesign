Focus:  Picking up and stacking the recycling cans

How:  using a rectangular convex suction mechanism to pick up the can from any side at any hight. Then place that can atop a stack of X number of totes

Positives:  Large ammounts of points for your team. Can prioritize getting the cans, so your team can place seven (7) cans on
            top on the tote stacks

            For seven stacks of three (3) totes. Your team will score 126 points per game (totes: 6 pts; can: 12 pts; exclude "litter")
            For seven stacks of six (6) totes. Your team will score 252 points per game (totes: 12 pts; cans: 24 pts; ecluse "litter")

            Very few teams will be able to pickup and stack cans as well as our team. Greater chance of being picked by a winning
            team

            If the suction is mounted on a turret, the cans can be obtained and place quickly

            Robot itself does not need to be extremely tall (just whatever is picking up the cans will need to be)

Negatives:  Dependant on the alliance. If other robots cannot stack totes, your score will be zero (0)

            Overextending the device will tip over the robot (stabilizers are recommended)



  ***if "litter" is added, score per game will be increased by 6 per stack. The robot can recieve the "litter" directly from the human player
