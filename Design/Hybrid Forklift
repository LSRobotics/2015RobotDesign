Focus: Pick up the recycling cans extremely efficiently, but have the ability to pick up and place the totes

How:  Forklift.
      Have the arms of the forklift curve out in the middle. Place rubber on the inside of the arms. This design will be able to 
      pick up the recycling cans as well as the totes
